  <p>The city was founded in 1879 by a group of miners who found silver and by 1892 was America's most productive silver mining district. The Aspen Ski Company was founded in 1946 and the city quickly grew to be the sking capital of North America. Four ski mountains make up the terrain for the world-renowned Aspen Snowmass resort. Aspen Mountain, locally referred to as Ajax, rises up directly from downtown, bringing a whole new meaning to ski-in/ski-out. Buttermilk Mountain, home of the Aspen X Games, is a kids' and beginners' paradise. Aspen Highlands boasts the legendary Highland Bowl, and Snowmass offers the largest acreage and diversity by having something for everyone.</p>

<p>Skiers know St. Moritz as one of the best ski destinations in Switzerland and as a two-time host of the Winter Olympics, but the possibilities for non-skiers are pretty amazing too. The active can take advantage of all of the usual off-piste options like snowshoeing, and adrenaline seekers will not want to miss the heart-pounding ride on the Olympic bob run that reaches speeds of 80 miles per hour. Other activities include taking a stroll through the highest shopping street in Europe, “Via Serlas,” which hosts all of the top brands and boutiques, enjoying spectator sports like cricket on ice and the Cartier Polo World Cup. If you would like to ride the rails, you may want to take the railway to the top of Muottas Muragi and watch the sunset or join an evening excursion to the Alp Grum, where fondue is served. This destination is also considered a “foodie heaven,” with five Michelin star restaurants, and it also receives an incredible 300+ days of sunshine each year.</p> */
